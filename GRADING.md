The grade is 19/20

-0.25 The table of results looks too optimistic. The time is measured incorrectly. Is it the time for generate_map instead of dijkstras?

-0.25 The complexity should be O(|V| + |E|log|E|).

-0.50 The execution and memory usage should not scale that well.

* The other questions are answered correcly.

* All the tests are passing.

* generate_map works properly.

* Web application works properly.

* The coding style is reasonable.

* All the team members seem to have contributed adequately.
